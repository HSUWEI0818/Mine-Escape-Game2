# Mine-Escape-Game2
I want to build a mine-stepping game. This game has 3 levels. The first level has n*n grids, and n grids contain bombs. Set n=5 for the first level. n decreases by 1 with each level. Each level requires pressing 3 grids. If you press a bomb, the game fails. If you don't press a bomb, the game progresses to the next level. If you pass all three levels, you win.
